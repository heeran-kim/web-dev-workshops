## üóÇ Workshop Overview

#### Week 1: Development Environment & Responsive Design
Set up a development environment and built a **responsive** social media page using HTML and Bootstrap, implementing basic structure and layout. [**View Details**](./week1/README.md)
- Directory: `week1/task4/` 

| Desktop View | Tablet View | Mobile View |
|---|---|---|
| ![Desktop View](./week1/task4/screenshots/desktop.png) | ![Tablet View](./week1/task4/screenshots/tablet.png) | ![Mobile View](./week1/task4/screenshots/mobile.png) |

#### Week 2: PHP Part 1
Implemented a social media page using PHP with **object-oriented principles** by creating Post and Comment classes, and enhanced code clarity and data safety through type declarations. [**View Details**](./week2/README.md)
- Directory: `week2/task2/`

| Desktop View (‚â• 992px)                    | Tablet View (Large: 768px ~ 991px)          | Tablet View (Small: 576px ~ 767px)          | Mobile View (‚â§ 575px)                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ![Desktop View](./week2/task2/screenshots/desktop.png) | ![Tablet Large View](./week2/task2/screenshots/tablet-large.png) | ![Tablet Small View](./week2/task2/screenshots/tablet-small.png) | ![Mobile View](./week2/task2/screenshots/mobile.png) |

**Note:** Comment sections are not functional yet.

#### Week 3: PHP Part 2
This week builds upon the Week 2 social media page by implementing **form handling** in PHP. Users can submit comments via forms using GET requests, with data stored and accessed through PHP **superglobals** like $_GET and $_REQUEST. The comment functionality was further enhanced by using PHP **sessions** to persist data across page reloads. Other tasks in this workshop demonstrated input validation, error handling, and file handling. [**View Details**](./week3/README.md)
- Directory: `week3/social-session/`

| Home Page | Comment Added |
|-|-|
| ![Home Page](./week3/social-session/screenshots/home.png) | ![Comment Added](./week3/social-session/screenshots/results.png) |

#### Week 4: Web Framework
This week focused on **Laravel**, covering routing, controllers, Blade templating, and CSRF protection.
These concepts were applied in user authentication, session management, and CRUD operations for posts and comments.

The highlight of this week is **My Social**, a social media app where users can sign up, create posts, and leave comments. It integrates authentication, database-driven content management, and dynamic comment persistence, ensuring that comments are stored in the database and displayed dynamically. Built using Laravel‚Äôs **MVC architecture, Blade templates, and Eloquent ORM**. [**View Details**](./week4/README.md)
- Directory: `week4/task6/`

| Guest View | Sign Up | Login | Create Post | User View | Leave Comment |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| ![Guest View](./week4/task6/screenshots/guest.png) | ![Sign Up](./week4/task6/screenshots/signup.png) | ![Login](./week4/task6/screenshots/login.png) | ![Create Post](./week4/task6/screenshots/post.png) | ![User View](./week4/task6/screenshots/user.png) | ![Leave Comment](./week4/task6/screenshots/comment.png) |

#### Week 5: Database and SQL
In Week 5, a relational schema was designed using SQLite, defining entity relationships and executing SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manage and retrieve data.
- Directory: `week5/`

#### Week 6 & 8: CRUD Operations & Database Migration & MVC
While separate workshop tasks for these weeks were not completed, full CRUD operations, database migrations, and MVC structure were extensively implemented in Assignment 1. [**View Assignment1**](https://github.com/yourusername/assignment1-repo)

#### Week 9 & 10: Input Validation, Authentication, and File Handling
These topics were covered in the final project, including secure authentication, input validation, file uploads, and pagination using Laravel‚Äôs built-in validation rules and middleware security measures. [**View Assignment2**](https://github.com/yourusername/assignment2-repo)

## üìö Course Overview
This course introduces the systematic development of dynamic, database-backed web applications using HTML/CSS, server-side programming languages (such as PHP), and modern web frameworks (e.g., Laravel). Through weekly exercises and projects, students will gain hands-on experience with CRUD operations, user authentication, database integration, input validation, and secure web application development.

---

## üèÜ Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Build secure, functional, database-backed dynamic web applications using a modern web framework.
2. Analyse project requirements and recommend suitable web technologies, frameworks, and databases.
