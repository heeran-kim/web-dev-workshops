## üóÇ Workshop Overview

#### Week 1: Development Environment & Responsive Design
Set up a development environment and built a **responsive** social media page using HTML and Bootstrap, implementing basic structure and layout. [**View Details**](./week1/README.md)
- Directory: `week1/task4/` 

| Desktop View | Tablet View | Mobile View |
|---|---|---|
| ![Desktop View](./week1/task4/screenshots/desktop.png) | ![Tablet View](./week1/task4/screenshots/tablet.png) | ![Mobile View](./week1/task4/screenshots/mobile.png) |

#### Week 2: PHP Part 1
Implemented a social media page using PHP with **object-oriented principles** by creating Post and Comment classes, and enhanced code clarity and data safety through type declarations. [**View Details**](./week2/README.md)
- Directory: `week2/task2/`

| Desktop View (‚â• 992px)                    | Tablet View (Large: 768px ~ 991px)          | Tablet View (Small: 576px ~ 767px)          | Mobile View (‚â§ 575px)                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ![Desktop View](./week2/task2/screenshots/desktop.png) | ![Tablet Large View](./week2/task2/screenshots/tablet-large.png) | ![Tablet Small View](./week2/task2/screenshots/tablet-small.png) | ![Mobile View](./week2/task2/screenshots/mobile.png) |

**Note:** Comment sections are not functional yet.

#### Week 3: PHP Part 2
This week builds upon the Week 2 social media page by implementing **form handling** in PHP. Users can submit comments via forms using GET requests, with data stored and accessed through PHP **superglobals** like $_GET and $_REQUEST. The comment functionality was further enhanced by using PHP **sessions** to persist data across page reloads. Other tasks in this workshop demonstrated input validation, error handling, and file handling. [**View Details**](./week3/README.md)
- Directory: `week3/social-session/`

| Home Page | Comment Added |
